# Instructions

Write a function to determine if a number _n_ is an Armstrong Number.

An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:

9 is an Armstrong number, because 9 = 9^1 = 9
10 is not an Armstrong number, because 10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1
153 is an Armstrong number, because: 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
154 is not an Armstrong number, because: 154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190
Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

# Examples

```
      isArmstrongNumber 10
0
      isArmstrongNumber 153
1
```

# Objectives

- Implement the `isArmstrongNumber` function in APL.
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.
